- How do we audit the movement of records? Can we maintain a chain of custody?
- How do we ensure no MITM tampering?

HUB AND SPOKE (with unlimited nodes and message passthrough)
-------------
Pros:
	- More flexible because the topology can adjust to political, administrative or technical shifts
	- Necessary custody chain tracking provides better visibility to flow of data
	- Fewer direct connections means less administrative burden
	- Does not require a central system owner (fully distributed)

Cons:
	- Much more complex tech (e.g., custody chain tracking, etc.)


DIRECT CONNECTIONS (with national registry and single hub)
------------------
Pros:
	- Simpler tech because no chain of custody management
	- Easier to understand the data flow and communicate how data is moving
	- Individual agencies/organizations can decide to join or not

Cons:
	- Major administrative challenges because every school district needs to sign on
	- Needs a central governing authority
	- Potentially could be seen as national "database"
