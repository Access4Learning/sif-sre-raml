    type: number
  navigationId:
    description: |
      Identifies state maintained in the Service Provider for the Consumer issuing the Paged Query Request. If returned, the Consumer must supply the navigationId value when requesting subsequent Pages of that object type from that Service Provider. This should not happen when queryIntention is set to NO-CACHING or ONE-OFF.

      It is included as an aid for the Consumer in detecting when to stop issuing Paged Query Requests.
  navigationPage:
    description: |
      The number of the Page to be returned. If it is outside the range of results (which does not constitute an error) an HTTP Response with a code of 204 (No Content) will be returned. The first page is indicated with the value 1 (i.e. navigationPage=1).
  navigationPageSize:
    description: |
      This is included in every Paged Query Request, and indicates the number of Objects to be returned in the corresponding Response Page. If the Page Size specified is too large for the Service or Environments Provider to supply, an Error with code 413 (Response too large) will be returned. When contained in the Response, it indicates the actual number of objects on the returned Page.
